(** Defines coercions and their basic operations. For us, a {i coercion} is a
    compile-time function on simple expressions that serves to add information
    to a type. A coercion must:

    + have an inverse (which is also a coercion), and
    + not alter the run-time value of its argument.

    Rule #1 allows us to treat a coerced name as an alias of the original name,
    since "is an alias of" remains an equivalence relation. Rule #2 means that a
    coerced [Simple.t] is still a valid [Simple.t], since it's still a register-
    sized value that we can substitute for free.

    Currently, we only use coercions to track the recursion depths of closures,
    but any type-level tweak that we want to attach to a term could be made a
    constructor of [t], so long as it follows the rules. *)
