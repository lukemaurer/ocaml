This is a test of the .mdflx system. It is only a test.
```flexpect
let i = 42 in
let symbol B = Block 0 (i) in
cont done (B)
===>
let symbol B = Block 0 (42) in
cont done (B)
```
This is also only a test:
```flexpect
let i = 4 in
let j = 8 in
let k = i + j in
let symbol B = Block 0 (k) in
cont done (B)
===>
let symbol B = Block 0 (12) in
cont done (B)
```
```flexpect
let i = 4 in
let symbol B = Block 0 () in
cont done (B)
===>
let symbol B = Block 0 () in
cont done (B)
```
